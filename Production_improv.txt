# Few Improvements for Production Version:

1. **Improve Code structure and readability**: 
   - Example: I have added a few print statements to debug data inputs/outputs and avoid issues like `TypeError` ("'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer"). These prints are currently commented out and should be removed for a production version.

2. **Enable logging**: 
   - Set up a proper logging configuration to capture errors, warnings, and other important events instead of relying on print statements.

3. **Database management**: 
   - If the app expands and uses a database, switch from in-memory storage to a persistent database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for better scalability and reliability.

4. **Error handling and Custom error pages**: 
   - Implement custom error handling for common HTTP errors (404, 500). This provides better feedback to users and avoids exposing internal details.

5. **Caching**: 
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance using tools like Redis or Memcached.

6. **Unit testing**: 
   - Add unit tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected and avoid regressions.

7. **Dockerize the application**: 
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app, making it easier to deploy and run consistently in different environments.

8. **Security enhancements**: 
   - Set a strong `SECRET_KEY`, enforce HTTPS, and implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules to enhance security.

9. **Use a production WSGI Server**: 
   - Flaskâ€™s built-in development server is not suitable for production. Use a production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
